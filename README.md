The Project Proposal Report is a document that outlines:
* What the goal of the project is and why is it of interest
* How data will be obtained for training and testing usage
* Overall structure and architecture of the model
* Plan and deadlines for task management

The Project Proposal Presentation is the visual aid to a presentation that quickly summarized the contents of the Project Proposal Report. It gives a brief explanation of:
* The main idea of the project
* Data collection, processing and labelling methods
* Architecture for the baselines and actual model
* Risks of the project
* Planned objectives before Progress Report

The Project Progress Report is to ensure that we are on track to complete the project as planned. It shows that we have made good progress on:
* Collecting almost all the data
* Producing a baseline model
* Producing at least one result, including one qualitative or quantitative comparison
* Reflecting upon the feedback given at proposal time
